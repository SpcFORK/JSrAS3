You can register event listeners on all nodes in the display list for a specific type of event, phase, and priority.\n     *\n     * After you successfully register an event listener, you cannot change its priority through additional calls to addEventListener().

Then you can register the listener again with the new priority level.\n     *\n     * After the listener is registered, subsequent calls to addEventListener() with a different value for either type or useCapture result in the creation of a separate listener registration. For example, if you first register a listener with useCapture set to true, it listens only during the capture phase. If you call addEventListener() again using the same listener object, but with useCapture set to false, you have two separate listeners: one that listens during the capture phase, and another that listens during the target and bubbling phases.\n     *\n     * You cannot register an event listener for only the target phase or the bubbling phase. Those phases are coupled during registration because bubbling applies only to the ancestors of the target node.\n     *\n     * When you no longer need an event listener, remove it by calling EventDispatcher.removeEventListener(); otherwise, memory problems might result. Objects with registered event listeners are not automatically removed from memory because the garbage collector does not remove objects that still have references.\n     *\n     * Copying an EventDispatcher instance does not copy the event listeners attached to it. (If your newly created node needs an event listener, you must attach the listener after creating the node.) However, if you move an EventDispatcher instance, the event listeners attached to it move along with it.\n     *\n     * If the event listener is being registered on a node while an event is also being processed on this node, the event listener is not triggered during the current phase but may be triggered during a later phase in the event flow, such as the bubbling phase.\n     *\n     * If an event listener is removed from a node while an event is being processed on the node, it is still triggered by the current actions.
