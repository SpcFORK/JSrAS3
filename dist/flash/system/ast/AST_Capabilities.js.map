For example, a mobile phone's screen might be 100 square pixels, black and white, whereas a PC screen might be 1000 square pixels, color. By using the Capabilities class to determine what capabilities the client has, you can provide appropriate content to as many users as possible. When you know the device's capabilities, you can tell the server to send the appropriate SWF files or tell the SWF file to alter its presentation.\n   * However, some capabilities of Adobe AIR are not listed as properties in the Capabilities class. They are properties of other classes:\n   *\n   * Property\tDescription\n   * NativeApplication.supportsDockIcon\tWhether the operating system supports application doc icons.\n   * NativeApplication.supportsMenu\tWhether the operating system supports a global application menu bar.\n   * NativeApplication.supportsSystemTrayIcon\tWhether the operating system supports system tray icons.\n   * NativeWindow.supportsMenu\tWhether the operating system supports window menus.\n   * NativeWindow.supportsTransparency\tWhether the operating system supports transparent windows.\n   *\n   * Do not use Capabilities.os or Capabilities.manufacturer to determine a capability based on the operating system. Basing a capability on the operating system is a bad idea, since it can lead to problems if an application does not consider all potential target operating systems. Instead, use the property corresponding to the capability for which you are testing.\n   *\n   * You can send capabilities information, which is stored in the Capabilities.serverString property as a URL-encoded string, using the GET or POST HTTP method. The following example shows a server string for a computer that has MP3 support and 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution, that is running Windows XP with an input method editor (IME) installed, and does not have support for multichannel audio:\n   *\n   * A=t&SA=t&SV=t&EV=t&MP3=t&AE=t&VE=t&ACC=f&PR=t&SP=t&\n     SB=f&DEB=t&V=WIN%209%2C0%2C0%2C0&M=Adobe%20Windows&\n     R=1600x1200&DP=72&COL=color&AR=1.0&OS=Windows%20XP&\n     L=en&PT=External&AVD=f&LFD=f&WD=f&IME=t&DD=f&\n     DDP=f&DTS=f&DTE=f&DTH=f&DTM=f\n   *\n   * The following table lists the properties of the Capabilities class and corresponding server strings.

Windowless mode can be disabled in Flash Player due to incompatibility with the web browser or to a user setting in the mms.cfg file.
