You can determine whether an IME is installed, whether or not the IME is currently enabled, and which IME is enabled. You can disable or enable the IME in the application, and you can perform other limited functions, depending on the operating system.\n   * AIR profile support: This feature is supported on desktop operating systems, but it is not supported on all mobile devices. It is also not supported on AIR for TV devices. You can test for support at run time using the IME.isSupported property. See AIR Profile Support for more information regarding API support across multiple profiles.\n   *\n   * IMEs let users type non-ASCII text characters in multibyte languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. For more information on working with IMEs, see the documentation for the operating system for which you are developing applications. For additional resources, see the following websites:\n   *\n   * http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/default.mspx\n   * http://developer.apple.com/documentation/\n   * http://java.sun.com\n   *\n   * If an IME is not active on the user's computer, calls to IME methods or properties, other than Capabilities.hasIME, will fail. Once you manually activate an IME, subsequent ActionScript calls to IME methods and properties will work as expected. For example, if you are using a Japanese IME, it must be activated before any IME method or property is called.\n   *\n   * The following table shows the platform coverage of this class:\n   *\n   * Capability\tWindows\tMac OSX\tLinux\n   * * Determine whether the IME is installed: Capabilities.hasIME\tYes\tYes\tYes\n   * * Set IME on or off: IME.enabled\tYes\tYes\tYes\n   * * Find out whether IME is on or off: IME.enabled\tYes\tYes\tYes\n   * * Get or set IME conversion mode: IME.conversionMode\tYes\tYes **\tNo\n   * * Send IME the string to be converted: IME.setCompositionString()\tYes *\tNo\tNo\n   * * Get from IME the original string before conversion: System.ime.addEventListener()\tYes *\tNo\tNo\n   * * Send request to convert to IME: IME.doConversion()\tYes *\tNo\tNo\n   *\n   * Not all Windows IMEs support all of these operations.
